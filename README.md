## Descripton
This is a mobile friendly app which allows a user to create a random password to meet selective criteria.

## Sub-goals:
This is the first version on my portfolio site. There is a lot that could be modified to make it neater. This site will be an ongoing progress.

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
